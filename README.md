# FullStack CRUD Student App

This is a full-stack application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student details. The frontend is built using React.js, and the backend is developed with Spring Boot.

## Overview

The FullStack CRUD Student App is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the integration of a React.js frontend with a Spring Boot backend to create a seamless web application for managing student information. This application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on student details, such as adding new students, viewing existing records, updating information, and deleting entries.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Styling**:  Tailwind CSS

## Features

- **Create**: Add new student records to the database.
- **Read**: View the list of existing student details.
- **Update**: Modify and update student information.
- **Delete**: Remove student entries from the system.

## Project Structure

- **frontend**: Contains the React.js application files.
- **backend**: Houses the Spring Boot backend code.
- **database**: ```bash
## Database

### Database Schema

The application uses a relational database to store information about students. Below is the schema for the main tables:

#### Students Table

| Field      | Type         | Description                          |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| id         | INT (PK)     | Unique identifier for each student.  |
| name       | VARCHAR(255) | Full name of the student.            |
| username   | VARCHAR(50)  | Username associated with the student.|
| email      | VARCHAR(255) | Email address of the student.        |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP    | Timestamp indicating record creation.|
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP    | Timestamp indicating last update.    |

### Database Setup

To set up the database for the application, follow these steps:

1. **Create Database:**
   - Create a new database in your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

2. **Run Migrations:**
   - Apply the provided database migrations or scripts to create the necessary tables and relationships.

   ```bash
   # Example for running migrations with a tool like Flyway or Liquibase
   ./mvnw flyway:migrate

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for the frontend.
